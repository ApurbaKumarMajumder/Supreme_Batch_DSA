# Evolution Of Languages

* Early computer languages were used for mathematical & scientific opeations
    - freed the programmer from the intricacies of assembly language
* Growth in size & complexity led to evolution in languages to accommodate new features
    - e.g. automation for business applications
* Slowly, the languages evoluved even more
    - software moved closer to problem domain and further away from machine

# Object Model

* The newer languages used classes & objects instead of subprograms & algorithms as building blocks
* These languages build upon object model
* The object model is based on three important concepts
    - object oriented analysis
    - object oriented design
    - object oriented programming

# Object Oriented Analysis

OO analysis is a method of analysis that examines the requirements from the perspective of the classes & objects found in the vocubulary of the problem domain.

* This is the first step for developing an object-oriented system
* Investigation of problem and requirements rather solution
* Focuses on what the system is supposed to do rather how it will be done
* Looks at the behaviour of the system independent of its domain
* Examines the real-world environment in which the system will operate
    - includes people and things that will interact to produce some result
    - analysed in a basic abstract forms, in multiple iterations
    - thesee abstractions later become classes in the problem domain

## OO Analysis Library

* Member requests a book from the library
* Librarian will search for the book
* If found, the book is issued
    - the database is updated with the issued book
* If unavailable, the request is placed in a queue
* If not found, an order may be placed for the book

## Analysis

* Highest level analysis or abstraction
* This will continue until objects are uniquely identified
* The objects are refined as abstractions with key characteristics
* Emphasis on investigation rather than the solution

# Object Oriented Design

OO design is a method of design encompassing the process of OO decomposition and a notation for depicting both logical and physical as well as static and dynamic models of the system under design.

* Focus on object oriented decomposition
* Uses different notations to express different models of the system
* High level concepts of analysis are mapped onto classes
* Hierarchical associations among the classes are designed
* Results in a detailed description that specifies how the system is to be build using different technologies

# Object Oriented Programming

It is a method of implementation in which programs are organized as cooperative collections of objects, each of which represents an instance of some class, and whose classes are all members of a hierarchy of classes united via inheritance relationships.

* Uses objects as fundamental blocks
* Classes & objects are related through relationships
* Requires a programming language that supports
    - objects as abstractions
    - classes
    - generalizzzation of classes
* Java, C++, C#, etc., can be used to write object oriented programs.

**Summary**

* Object model builds upon three important concepts
* OO analysis, design & programming
* Analysis focuses on problem
* Design is about OO decomposition and expression of the design using some notations.
* Programming is the implementation using an OO language.
