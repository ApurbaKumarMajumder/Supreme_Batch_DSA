# Why Model Software System

* Software development is complex
* Modelling can help build a system easily & quickly
* Useful in simulations
* Can evolve when our understand of the system increases
* We can choose the details in the model
* Simple view of the system
* No need to dig into the system for details
* A model can represent real or abstract things in any domain

# Model

A model is an abstraction of something that exists in real life

A model captures the view of a physical system. It is an abstraction of the physical system, with a certain purpose. This purpose determines what is to be included in the model and what is irrelevant. Thus, the model completely describes those aspects of the physical system that are relevant to the purpose of the model, at an appropriate level of details.

# Modelling Language

* Made up of pseudo-code, pictures, comments, diagrams, etc
* These elements make up to a modelling language
    - called notations
* Code may be used for modelling
    - too verbose i.e. information overload
    - only models implementation, not design
    - cannot be easily ported to other implementations
    - does not give a bigger picture of the system
    - clients may not understand code
