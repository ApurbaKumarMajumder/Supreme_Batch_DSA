# Object Definition

An objeect represents an individial, identifiable item, unit or entity, either real or abstract, with a well defined role in the problem domain.

* Model some part of reeality
* Exists in space and time
* Can be invented as outcome of a design process
* Has weell-dedfined behaviour and a defiite purpose.
* Collaborate with other objects to provide a heigher-level behaviour.

# Characteristics

* An object has the following characteristics:
    - state
    - identify
    - behaviour
* The structure and behaviour of similar objects are specified in a class
    - object is an instance of such class.
    - a class is the blueprint for objects.
* Forms the building block of an application.

# State

* Properties and their values constitute the state of an object.
* Appear as attributes of an object
    - fields
    - member variables
* Can be of two types
    - static - fundamental attributes that don't change
    - dynamic - attributes that change as a result of operation performed on the object.

# Identity

* Trait that makes an object unique and gives it individuality.
* Represented through one or mmoree attributes of the object.
    - address of an object can be used to represent its identity in some cases
* Helps identify objects in a system
* Examples:
    - Speak System - Series no.
    - Cellphone - IMEI no.
    - Person - Social security no.

# Behaviour

* Response of the object during interaction
* Part of the responsibility of an object
* Arises due to binding between attributes and operations
    - operations will internally change the state of the object
    - this culminates into the behavoiur of the object
* Appear as operations (member functions, methods)
* Examples:
    - speaker system - ChangeVolume, ChangeBass, ChangeTreble, EqualizeLoudness
    - cellphone - SendText, Dial, AcceptCall, Connect

**Symmary**

* Object is an entity, real or abstract, identifiable, in some problem domain
* Has the following characteristics
    - state
    - identity
    - behaviour
* Their blueprint is represeented by a class
* Objects do not exist in isolation
* Interdependent, coordinate.
